### Stock Market Investment Jargons:

#### Market Cap
It is the total amount needed to buy all the stocks of a company, 'the cost of a company'.
```
MarketCap/TotalNumberOfShares = Price of one Share
```

#### Share Price
- LTP (last traded price): The price of one share right now
- Opening price: The cost of one share when the stock market opened today
- Closing price: The cost one one share when the stock market closed today

#### Percentage Change
It is the percent change in the price of a share from it's previous day's closing price
```
PercentageChange = 100 * (LTP - PrevDayClosingPrice) / PrevDayClosingPrice
```

#### Asset
Something that we can own which can be converted into cash
Eg: A house worth rupees 1Cr, Gold worth rupees 50Lac, Stocks worth rupees 1Cr, etc.

#### Liability
Something that we can own which will can be converted into negetive cash
Eg: Home loan worth rupees 50Lac, Short sold stock worth rupees 20Lac, etc.


#### Net Worth
It is the total amount of cash a person can have
```
NetWorth = TotalAssets - TotalLiabilities
```

#### Equity and Debt 
**Equity** is the amount of ownership of an an asset
Eg: Say I buy a car worth rupees 10Lac and I pay 3Lac myself, but take 7Lac loan. In such a case, I own 30% of the car, or my equity is of 30% in that car which is 3Lac rupees.
```
Equity = Asset - Debt
```

**Debt** is the amount of money that I have to *pay back* to someone.
In the above example, we can see that my debt is 70% which is 7Lac rupees.

--- 

**Example of a company**:
- Say me and my two friends open a Tech company (we are the `promoters`)
- Each of us put 20Lac rupees in it, which means we have 20x3 = 60Lac rupees 
- We take a loan of 40Lac rupees from a bank => company's `debt`
- Now we have 1Cr rupees for the company
- We hire people, we generate ideas, we make websites, we buy computers, we already invested 60Lac rupees, etc => The company's `assets`

State:
    - Assets = 100Lac
    - Debt   = 40Lac
    - Equity = 100Lac - 40Lac = 60Lac
    - Shareholding = 100% by promoters
    
At this point each of me and my friends own equal ownership of the company (1/3 each)

- Now the company grows, we make good profits, we want to now expand the company to more locations, serve more customers, etc
- Thus we need more assets, so we find the valuation of our company, we find the valuation is 10Cr
- Say, we need 2Cr of total investment now to grow the bussiness
- We take a loan of 1Cr from the bank => more `debt` for the company
- For the other 1Cr, we open up our company for equity investments, which means we diluted the shares(ownership) of our company by 10%.
- Investors will now invest their money into our company and we will get the 1Cr rupees from them.

State:
    - Funds Raised = 2Cr
    - Equity       = 1Cr (Investors) => Will not have to be paid back 
    - Debt         = 1Cr (Lenders = Bank Loan) => Will have to be paid back, with interest
    - Shareholding = 10% by Investors and 90% by promoters

- Basically, there are some investors who hold 10% ownership of our company, they can be fetched via public(share-market0 or private(friends/family) investestments
- Me and my friends now hold 30% ownership of the company each and will own 30% of whatever value the company grows to.
- The bank doesn't get ownership of the company, they only get their money back with interest, irrespective of the company's growth
- The investors will get 10% of whatever value the company grows to.

Risk: 
  - Investors have a high risk where their returns vary from 0% to infinity.
  - The Lenders have a lower risk since they will keep getting their interest back per year, and in a case that the company goes bankrupt (debt > assets) (equity < 0) the lenders have the first right to auction the assets off to get their money back

Types of Investors:
- public(stock market)
- private (Private equity(PE), venture capitalists, angels, self)

Types of Lenders:
- Banks
- Financial Instituitions (FIs)
- Corporate Bonds
- Government Bonds (TBD)

Types of equity investments;
- Stocks
- Mutual funds (TBD)
- SIPs (TBD)
- ULIPs (unit link insurance plans, TBD)
- ELSS (equity linked saving services, TBD)
- Private equity firms
- Startups
- Bussiness
- Franchise

#### Liquidity
It is essentially how easily an asset can be exchanged, a measure of the current market activity
(If many people are trading a stock, you can easily sell that stock at any time you want)
liquidity can be thought of as the rate of conversion of an asset into cash
- Cash/Stocks are generally of high liquidity
- Real Estate is low liquidity, harder to sell generally
More liquidity = Good


#### Solvency



#### Market depth
It shows the last 5 or 20 trades that happened on the stock, more the bids/offers, more is the liquidity

#### Product Type
- CNC (Cash and Carry):  Buy a stock for long term investment, will be held
- MIS

#### Stock Status

T   Day: The day of trading a stock (first day) => Stock shows up on Positions (Intraday trading allowed)
T+1 Day: The first day after trading a stock (second day) => Stock shows up in Holdings (Now Intraday is over)
T+2 Day: The second day after trading a stock (third day) => Stock is now settled and will be delivered to the demat account.
