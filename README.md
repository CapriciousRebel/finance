## Stock Market Investment Jargons:

### Fundamental analysis:

#### 1. Market Cap:
It is the total amount needed to buy all the stocks of a company, 'the cost of a company'. 
Shows us the "size" of the company.
```
MarketCap / TotalNumberOfShares = Price of one Share
```
---
#### 2. SP (Share Price):
- LTP (last traded price): The price paid for a the last share that was traded.
- Opening price: The cost of one share when the stock market opened today
- Closing price: The cost one one share when the stock market closed today
---
#### 3. EPS (Earning Per Share):
It is the net profit divided by number of shares
```
EarningPerShare = NetProfit/NumberOfShares
```
---
#### 4. P/E (Price over earnings) ratio:
It is the ratio of the price of a share divided by the earnings made from the share
It is a measure of how much value people give to this share
- High P/E ratio means that the share is overvalued
- Low P/E ratio means that the share is undervalued
```
PERatio = SharePrice/EarningPerShare
```
---
#### 5. Valuation chart:
A plot of the PERatio vs time.
- If the current PERatio is at a maxima, that may mean that the share is being given too much value, so we may want to ask why that is, is it because of something good being done by the company? Will this value increase in the future? What happended in the past when the share was given a high value? Of course the value will fall, but when will it fall? We need some reading here to judge the comapany.
- If the current PERatio is at a minima, that means that the share is being given a lower value, again the same question arises, "why?". Look at the history a bit, see if the company has recovered such drops well in the past. If it was able to recover well, then maybe that stock should be bought, it has a good chance of giving you better return value.

But that is not enough to judge a company.
---
#### 6. Profit growth chart:
A plot of the growth in profit over a time (generally 1yr, 3yr, 5yr)
- This chart tells us how the company's profit has grown over the years. Hence we get an idea of the EPS as well, which in turn gives us an idea of the PERatio and the valuation chart of the company.

As the company keeps giving better and better profit growth, it increases the investors' confidence in the share and they give more value to it, in such a case, we see that `ProfitGrowth↑ -> EarningPerShare↑ -> SharePrice↑ -> Valuation↑ -> PERatio?` Because SP↑ and EPS↑ hence if PERatio increases in such a case, it means people believe in the share more, but if it doesn't, it may mean that people dont trust that share too much

If the  Profit growth of a company is increasing, but the P/E is not increasing then it means that the stock is not getting enough value as much as it deserves

#### 7. 

#### Percentage Change
It is the percent change in the price of a share from it's previous day's closing price
```
PercentageChange = 100 * (LTP - PrevDayClosingPrice) / PrevDayClosingPrice
```

#### Asset
Something that we can own which can be converted into cash
Eg: A house worth rupees 1Cr, Gold worth rupees 50Lac, Stocks worth rupees 1Cr, etc.

#### Liability
Something that we can own which will can be converted into negetive cash
Eg: Home loan worth rupees 50Lac, Short sold stock worth rupees 20Lac, etc.


#### Net Worth
It is the total amount of cash a person can have
```
NetWorth = TotalAssets - TotalLiabilities
```

#### Equity and Debt 
**Equity** is the amount of ownership of an an asset
Eg: Say I buy a car worth rupees 10Lac and I pay 3Lac myself, but take 7Lac loan. In such a case, I own 30% of the car, or my equity is of 30% in that car which is 3Lac rupees.
```
Equity = Asset - Debt
```

**Debt** is the amount of money that I have to *pay back* to someone.
In the above example, we can see that my debt is 70% which is 7Lac rupees.

--- 

**Example of a company**:
- Say me and my two friends open a Tech company (we are the `promoters`)
- Each of us put 20Lac rupees in it, which means we have 20x3 = 60Lac rupees 
- We take a loan of 40Lac rupees from a bank => company's `debt`
- Now we have 1Cr rupees for the company
- We hire people, we generate ideas, we make websites, we buy computers, we already invested 60Lac rupees, etc => The company's `assets`

State:
    - Assets = 100Lac
    - Debt   = 40Lac
    - Equity = 100Lac - 40Lac = 60Lac
    - Shareholding = 100% by promoters
    
At this point each of me and my friends own equal ownership of the company (1/3 each)

- Now the company grows, we make good profits, we want to now expand the company to more locations, serve more customers, etc
- Thus we need more assets, so we find the valuation of our company, we find the valuation is 10Cr
- Say, we need 2Cr of total investment now to grow the bussiness
- We take a loan of 1Cr from the bank => more `debt` for the company
- For the other 1Cr, we open up our company for equity investments, which means we diluted the shares(ownership) of our company by 10%.
- Investors will now invest their money into our company and we will get the 1Cr rupees from them.

State:
    - Funds Raised = 2Cr
    - Equity       = 1Cr (Investors) => Will not have to be paid back 
    - Debt         = 1Cr (Lenders = Bank Loan) => Will have to be paid back, with interest
    - Shareholding = 10% by Investors and 90% by promoters

- Basically, there are some investors who hold 10% ownership of our company, they can be fetched via public(share-market0 or private(friends/family) investestments
- Me and my friends now hold 30% ownership of the company each and will own 30% of whatever value the company grows to.
- The bank doesn't get ownership of the company, they only get their money back with interest, irrespective of the company's growth
- The investors will get 10% of whatever value the company grows to.

Risk: 
  - Investors have a high risk where their returns vary from 0% to infinity.
  - The Lenders have a lower risk since they will keep getting their interest back per year, and in a case that the company goes bankrupt (debt > assets) (equity < 0) the lenders have the first right to auction the assets off to get their money back

Types of Investors:
- public(stock market)
- private (Private equity(PE), venture capitalists, angels, self)

Types of Lenders:
- Banks
- Financial Instituitions (FIs)
- Corporate Bonds
- Government Bonds (TBD)

Types of equity investments;
- Stocks
- Mutual funds (TBD)
- SIPs (TBD)
- ULIPs (unit link insurance plans, TBD)
- ELSS (equity linked saving services, TBD)
- Private equity firms
- Startups
- Bussiness
- Franchise

Types of debts:
- Loans
- Debt Products
- Bonds

#### Liquidity
It is essentially how easily an asset can be exchanged, a measure of the current market activity
(If many people are trading a stock, you can easily sell that stock at any time you want)
Liquidity can be thought of as the rate of conversion of an asset into cash
Liquidity considers short term assets and liabilities
`Short term means under one year`

- Cash/Stocks are generally of high liquidity
- Real Estate is low liquidity, harder to sell generally
More liquidity is important

#### liquidity ratios:
These tell us about short term financial position of a company
1. Current Ratio
2. Quick Ratio
3. Cash Ratio

#### solvency ratios:
These tell us about long term financial position of a company
1. Debt ratio
2. Debt to equity ratio
3. Interest coverage ratio
4. Debt service coverage ratio


#### Solvency and Insolvency
`If Net-Worth > 0 the solvency = true`
`If NetWorth < 0 then Insolvency = true`

#### Market depth
It shows the last 5 or 20 trades that happened on the stock, more the bids/offers, more is the liquidity

#### Product Type
- CNC (Cash and Carry):  Buy a stock for long term investment, will be held
- MIS

#### Stock Status

T   Day: The day of trading a stock (first day) => Stock shows up on Positions (Intraday trading allowed)
T+1 Day: The first day after trading a stock (second day) => Stock shows up in Holdings (Now Intraday is over)
T+2 Day: The second day after trading a stock (third day) => Stock is now settled and will be delivered to the demat account.


#### Patterns, Bearish, Bullish
**Bullish**: A bull is powerful animal, and hence Bullish means that the stock is going up.
**Bearish**: A bear is a weak animal, and hence Bearish means that the stock is going down.

A buyer, when buys a stock, believes that the stock is bullish, that it's price will go up, hence buyers are said to be bullish.
A seller, when sells a stock believes that the stock is bearish, that it's price will go down, hence sellers are said to be bearish.

When people think a stock is bullish, they buy the stock, and are willing to pay a higher price for it, which in turn causes the stock to rise, but then people see the stock being very powerful, and they start reaping their profits, and start selling the stock, at there is a general vibe that the stock is bearish, so people start selling the stock. And then the cycle repeats itself, hence there is always a pattern of maxima and minima in the price of a stock


#### Types of orders:
**CNC**: Cash And Carry -> Buys a stock that can not be sold on the same day, it will send delivery of the stock in your demat account after T+2 days.
**MIS**: Margin Intraday Squareoff -> Buys/Sells a stock which has to be sold/bought on the same day, if not sold/bought till 15:10 hrs, then the broker will do it for you (square off) at the current trading price.
